Unity is a desktop experience that sings. Designed by Canonical and the Ayatana community, Unity is all about the combination of familiarity and the future. We bring together visual design, analysis of user experience testing, modern graphics technologies and a deep understanding of the free software landscape to produce what we hope will be the lightest, most elegant and most delightful way to use your PC.

Unity is free software, you are encouraged to use whatever pieces of it suit you. We discuss its evolution on the Ayatana mailing lists for developers and designers. We embrace the values of GNOME: simplicity, style, usability and accessibility, and we embrace professional, considered design thinking.

The Unity desktop experience is designed to allow for multiple implementations, currently, Unity consists of a Compiz plugin based visual interface only, which is heavily dependent on OpenGL.
